An important question arise: 
can we push the boundary of paper- and computer- based test a
little further while maintaining the security offered by CBT systems? The
short answer is: yes, we can try. The long answer is we can push the
boundary a little further than we already have. The use of smart mobile
computing devices is so rampant today that we can roughly estimate that a
little above 90% of students in higher institutions of learning today have
one smart phone each. The devices are powered by technologies that have
close proximity to modern computers, although some are with tinnier
screens, but they have the similar, if not the same, underlying technology
and thus can be asserted to do what modern computers can do. As the
popular saying goes, the sky is the limit. Limiting tests taking to computers
cannot be taken anymore, therefore, this projects tries to simulate the CBT
system to mobile-computing devices using today's technology to
implement the security enjoyed by CBT systems.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
=======================
It is admitted today that the challenges faced with Pencil-Paper Test
(PPT) or Paper based test and Computer Based Test is overwhelming, they
include but not limited to exam malpractice, inaccuracy in marking, delay in
marking results, limited computers, and time constraint. These challenges
do not help in the growth of the education sector in Nigeria. Although,
Computer Based Test are economical and accurate, we are sometimes
faced with the problem of limited resources, the primary resources being
electricity, limited computer, very few man-power.
Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Institutions can adopt this new
system to solve challenges noted above. Examination bodies such as the
Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) which use CBT systems
extensively can adopt this Secured MBT that caters for her examinations
across their centres nationwide. This will aid the examination to curb
challenges faced with the CBT system of examination.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
==========================
The main objective of the research project is to design and
implement a secure MBT system. Specific objectives of the research paper
are:

    To develop a secured MBT system powered by Android OS that behaves identically to CBT systems taken on computers.
    To develop a secured MBT system with enhanced security features to avoid exam malpractice.
    To design a secure MBT system with real time processing of questions and timely submission of tests.
